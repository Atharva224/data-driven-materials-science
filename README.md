# üß† Predicting the Bulk Modulus of Inorganic Crystals

This repository contains a data-driven machine learning pipeline developed for predicting the bulk modulus of inorganic crystals. The project was completed as part of the *Materials Informatics* module at FAU and explores PCA-based dimensionality reduction and various regression models. Techniques include Lasso, Ridge, Tree regressors, Kernel Ridge Regression, and feature selection methods.

## üß† Key Concepts

- Dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Linear models: Least Squares, Ridge, Lasso (with regularization tuning)
- Polynomial feature expansion with cross terms
- Tree-based regressors: Decision Trees, Adaboost
- Kernel Ridge Regression with RBF and polynomial kernels
- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Least Angle Regression (LARS)
- Evaluation metrics: \( R^2 \), MSE, RMSE, model stability with training size
- Feature importance ranking and physical interpretability
